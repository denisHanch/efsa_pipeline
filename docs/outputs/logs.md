## Description

The `logs/` folder contains **detailed logs and command scripts** for each Nextflow process.

## File Descriptions

### `.command.begin`
Marks the start time of a process.

### `.command.err`
Captures standard error messages generated by the process.

### `.command.log`
General execution logs from Nextflow for the process.

### `.command.out`
Captures standard output of the process.

### `.command.run`
Metadata about process execution including:

- Exit code
- Runtime duration
- Resource usage

### `.command.sh`
The shell script that Nextflow runs; contains the exact commands for the process.

## Usage

These log files are useful for:

- **Debugging** - Identify what went wrong when a process fails
- **Reproducibility** - See exact commands that were executed
- **Performance monitoring** - Check resource usage and execution times
- **Troubleshooting** - Review error messages and output

## Accessing Logs

Logs are typically found in the Nextflow `work/` directory under each process-specific subdirectory. After pipeline completion with `--clean_work true`, the work directory is removed, but key logs may still be available in the output directory.
