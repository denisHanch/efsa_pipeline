# Output Documentation

This section provides detailed documentation for all pipeline outputs generated by the EFSA pipeline.

## Overview

After running the Nextflow pipeline, outputs are organized in the `data/outputs/` directory. Each subfolder contains results from different analysis workflows.

## Output Categories

### whole-genome assemblies Comparison with SyRI

- **[Reference vs Modified FASTA](fasta-ref-mod.md)** - Results from comparing reference and modified genome assemblies using SyRI and other tools

### Short-Read Analysis

- **[Short-Read Processing Pipeline Results (Illumina)](illumina.md)** - Short-read mapping results including BAM files, VCF variants, and coverage statistics

### Long-Read Analysis

- **[Long-Read Processing Pipeline Results (PacBio & Oxford Nanopore)](long-reads.md)** - Long-read mapping results from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore sequencing

### Variant Analysis with Truvari

- **[VCF Comparison with Truvari](truvari.md)** - Structural variant benchmarking and comparison results

### Quality Metrics

- **[Unmapped Statistics](unmapped-stats.md)** - Summary statistics of unmapped reads for each workflow
- **[Logs](logs.md)** - Pipeline execution logs and command history
